## Assignment: Agent-Orchestration Framework with LangChain

### Milestone 1: Environment Setup & Basic Agent Creation
Objective: Install LangChain and create a foundational conversational agent.
Week 1:
 • Set up Python + LangChain development environment
 • Explore LangChain’s core building blocks: LLMs, Prompts, Chains, and Agents
 • Connect to a language model (real or simulated)
 • Build a simple LangChain agent to respond to static queries
Week 2:
 • Experiment with agent types (e.g., zero-shot-react-description)
 • Create prompt templates and build basic I/O logic
 • Implement a console interface for interactive testing
Output:
• Functional LangChain environment
• Basic single-agent prototype with prompt-based interaction
• Console-based interface for user interaction
